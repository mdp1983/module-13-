## **A little about me**

See my [A little about me](/A little about me/) page for details.

I am 38 years old, married with 4 boys.  I graduated from _Smithton_ H.S. in 2002.  
I love to play the drums, all though there is no time anymore with a new baby.  
The house is quite full and we are always busy.  My older two boys are into football and baseball.  
I coach my own U12 competitive baseball team.  My older boys and I like [garden tractor pulling](https://ngtps.org/).

### ** I also Like the following **
* Camping
* Fishing
* Swimming
* The Chiefs
* The Royals
